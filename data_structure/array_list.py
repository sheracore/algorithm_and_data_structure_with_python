List or Array
- In regular array(list, array) items store sequentially in memory next to each other
- lookup O(1): because the calculation of the memory address is very simple it doesn't involve any loop or complex
- insert/delete: O(n): It may require shifting the elements after the insertion/deletion point(worst case scenario O(n)
but for the best case scenario it will be O(1) )
